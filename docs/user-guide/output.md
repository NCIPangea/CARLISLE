# Expected Outputs

Upon successful completion, CARLISLE generates a comprehensive directory structure under `WORKDIR/results`. Each subdirectory contains outputs corresponding to specific stages of the workflow â€” from raw alignment statistics to annotated peak results and quality control summaries.

---

## Directory Overview

* **`alignment_stats/`** â€“ Contains detailed alignment reports for each sample, including mapping efficiency, read depth, and spike-in alignment metrics.

* **`bam/`** â€“ Stores sorted and indexed **BAM** files for all samples. This directory also includes per-sample and spike-in alignment statistics useful for downstream normalization and QC.

* **`bedgraph/`** â€“ Includes **BEDGRAPH** coverage tracks summarizing read density across the genome. These files serve as intermediates for visualization and peak-calling validation.

* **`bigwig/`** â€“ Contains **BigWig** files generated from normalized coverage data, suitable for visualization in genome browsers such as **[UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/)** or **[IGV](https://igv.org/)**.

* **`fragments/`** â€“ Stores fragment length distributions and deduplicated fragment data (particularly important for **CUT&RUN** and **CUT&Tag** experiments). Useful for assessing fragment size enrichment and MNase digestion efficiency.

* **`peaks/`** â€“ The core results directory containing called peaks, differential comparisons, and annotations.

  * Subdirectories are organized by **quality thresholds** (e.g., `0.05`, `0.01`), representing the significance cutoffs applied during peak calling.
  * Each quality threshold directory includes:

    * **`contrasts/`** â€“ Contains results of differential binding analyses defined in the contrast manifest.
    * **`<peak_caller>/`** â€“ Subdirectories for each peak caller (e.g., `macs2`, `seacr`, `gopeaks`). Each includes raw peak calls and annotated results.

      * **`annotation/`** â€“ Contains enriched feature and pathway analyses:

        * **`go_enrichment/`** â€“ Results from **[ChIP-Enrich](https://chipenrich.med.umich.edu/)** gene set enrichment, generated when `run_go_enrichment: true` is enabled.
        * **`homer/`** â€“ Output from **[HOMER](http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/)** motif discovery and annotation.
        * **`rose/`** â€“ Output from **[ROSE](https://bitbucket.org/young_computation/rose/src/master/)** super-enhancer analysis, generated when `run_rose: true` is specified.

* **`qc/`** â€“ Centralized quality control directory containing comprehensive **[MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/)** summaries, **FastQC** metrics, and spike-in normalization reports (when applicable).
