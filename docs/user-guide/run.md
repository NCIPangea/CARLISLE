# Running the Pipeline

## Pipeline Overview

The **CARLISLE** pipeline operates as a modular **[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)** workflow, designed to support flexible execution on both local and cluster environments. It offers several run modes that control initialization, execution, and management of analysis sessions.

### Required Arguments

```bash
Usage: carlisle -m/--runmode=<RUNMODE> -w/--workdir=<WORKDIR>

1. RUNMODE [string]:
   init      ‚Äì Initialize the working directory
   run       ‚Äì Submit jobs to the SLURM cluster (Biowulf)
   reset     ‚Äì Delete and reinitialize the working directory
   dryrun    ‚Äì Validate and preview the workflow (no jobs executed)
   unlock    ‚Äì Unlock the working directory after an aborted run
   runlocal  ‚Äì Execute the pipeline interactively on a local node
   runtest   ‚Äì Run the included test dataset on the cluster

2. WORKDIR [string]:
   Absolute or relative path to the desired output directory with write permissions.
```

### Optional Arguments

| Flag              | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--help, -h`      | Display the command-line help message.                                                                                                  |
| `--version, -v`   | Print the current version of CARLISLE.                                                                                                  |
| `--force, -f`     | Force re-execution of all Snakemake rules (overrides cache).                                                                            |
| `--singcache, -c` | Define a custom **Singularity cache directory**. Defaults to `/data/${USER}/.singularity`, or `${WORKDIR}/.singularity` if unavailable. |

## Command Descriptions

### üß© Preparation Commands

* **`init` (required)** ‚Äì Initializes the working directory by copying configuration, manifest, and Snakefiles into place. This step must be performed before any other pipeline action.

  * Use the `-f` or `--force` flag to reinitialize an existing directory.

* **`dryrun` (optional)** ‚Äì Performs a non-executing validation of the Snakemake DAG, checking for syntax issues, missing files, or permission problems before a full run.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Processing Commands

* **`runlocal`** ‚Äì Executes the workflow on a local interactive node. This mode is suitable for quick testing or smaller datasets but should only be used within a Biowulf interactive session (`sinteractive`).

* **`run`** ‚Äì Submits the workflow to the **[Biowulf HPC cluster](https://hpc.nih.gov/)** via SLURM. CARLISLE manages job scheduling, dependencies, and notifications. Email alerts are automatically sent for job start, errors, and completion.

### üß∞ Maintenance Commands

* **`unlock`** ‚Äì Unlocks the working directory if Snakemake terminates unexpectedly or a previous job is interrupted.

* **`runtest`** ‚Äì Executes a small, bundled test dataset to verify installation and configuration integrity.

## Usage Syntax

All commands follow a consistent syntax:

```bash
carlisle --runmode=<COMMAND> --workdir=/path/to/output/dir
```

For example:

```bash
carlisle --runmode=init --workdir=/data/$USER/project
```

---

## Typical Workflow Example

A standard execution sequence on the Biowulf cluster would include the following steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Initialize working directory
carlisle --runmode=init --workdir=/path/to/output/dir

# Step 2: Perform a dry run to validate the workflow
carlisle --runmode=dryrun --workdir=/path/to/output/dir

# Step 3: Submit the full workflow to the cluster
carlisle --runmode=run --workdir=/path/to/output/dir
```

> ‚úÖ **Recommendation:** Always perform a dry run before full execution to verify file paths, environment modules, and configuration correctness.
